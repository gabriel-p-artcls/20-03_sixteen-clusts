\section{Introduction}

Galactic open clusters are routinely used as probes of the structure and
evolution of the Milky Way disk. Their fundamental parameters, like age,
distance, and metallicity allow us to define the large scale structure of the
disk and to cast light on its origin and assembly \citep{Janes_1982,
Moitinho_2010,2018A&A...618A..93C}. Young open clusters can be used to trace
spiral arms and star forming regions \citep{Moitinho_2006,Vazquez2008}, while
older clusters are better probes of the chemical evolution of the thin disk
\citep{2009yCat..35120063M}. The recent second release of Gaia satellite data
\citep{GaiaDR2_2018} is producing a tremendous advance in the study of the
Galactic disk and its star cluster population.

Basic parameters for a large number of clusters are now available with
unprecedented accuracy \citep{2018A&A...618A..93C,Soubiran_2018,Bossini_2019}.
Proper motions may be employed to select cluster members and parallaxes can be
used to derive distances. However, it comes to happen that in some cases Gaia
parallax distances strongly disagree with distances derived from other methods 
(i.e., photometric or spectrophotometric). It may occur that for reasonably
short distances the photometric and parallax distances yield similar results
within the uncertainties \citep{2018A&A...618A..93C}. But the situation is
truly complex regarding the existence of a bias correction to be applied to
Gaia parallaxes. As a size limited example we mention parallax distance biases
dependent on the sky position determined by \cite{Lindegren_2018}. More
recently, by analyzing a sample of stars \cite{Schonrich2019} have put in
evidence that not only a parallax offset must be applied to Gaia data but also
that exists a quasi linear dependence with distances. Interestingly is the,
also recent, case presented by \cite{Xu_2019} who compared distances between
Gaia and VLBI parallaxes founding a very large offset. 
It is difficult to establish the critical distance at which Gaia parallax
distances start diverging from values from other methods and if there is a
positional or distance dependence of any probable bias value. So, the  task of
establishing distances and other essential parameters for open clusters using
the Gaia data looks an arduous one, since other factors such as the
interstellar absorption and the level of crowding of a given star cluster, play
also a crucial role to uncover its fundamental parameters.

In this article we present a sample of previously unstudied star clusters
located in a poorly known Galactic sector, at approximately
$270^\circ<l<300^\circ$ along the galactic plane. With one exception, this is
the first systematic study carried out for the clusters in our sample. In this
sense, we provide CCD \textit{UBVI} photometry complemented with data available
from Gaia DR2. The purpose of this investigation is twofold. Firstly, we look
for a reliable estimation of the true nature of these objects. Gaia DR2 offers
us a unique oportunity since we can make our analysis more robust by combining 
\textit{UBVI} CCD data with Gaia DR2 ($G$ magnitude, parallax, and proper
motions). Secondly, we want to have a look to the Galactic structure in this
region. This is, on a side one would expect to find here traces of the Perseus
Arm coming out of the third Galactic quadrant despite this arm is only
prominent in the second quadrant and, on the other, some of these clusters may
be probably associated to the Carina Arm. 

Anyway, analyzing this portion of the Galaxy has proved to be a quite difficult
task since the extinction is particularly strong and variable. This
makes it cumbersome not only to derive solid basic parameters of a cluster,
but, even worse, to establish if a visual stellar aggregate is a physical
cluster or simply a random enhancement of field stars produced by patchy
reddening. 
%
For achieving these two purposes we employed the Automated Stellar
Cluster Analysis code \citep[\texttt{ASteCA};][]{Perren_2015} to derive
clusters' fundamental parameters from \textit{G-UBVI} data, and a Bayesian
technique to extract membership and distances from Gaia DR2. The sample of
clusters studied in this paper is shown in Table 1 together with their absolute
coordinates referred to the J2000.0 equinox and also the galactic ones.

The layout of the paper is as follows: in Section \ref{sec:clust_sample} we
present the cluster sample indicating their positions in the Galaxy.
Section \ref{sec:photo_obs} is devoted to explain the observations and the
reduction process of photometry. In Section \ref{sec:photom_analysis} we
describe the tools to analyze the photometric data and the method to connect
Gaia DR2 with photometric results. A cluster by cluster report of the results
obtained is presented in Section \ref{sec:cluster_discuss}. In Section
\ref{sec:gaia_distances} three different possible offsets to Gaia DR2 parallax
data are applied and discussed. Conclusions of the paper are given in Section 
\ref{sec:results_concl}.

\section{Photometric observations}
\label{sec:photo_obs}

A first series of CCD \emph{UBVI} photometry was carried out in 13 open clusters
placed in the galactic region going from 280$^\circ$ to 300$^\circ$ in galactic
longitude and from 7$^\circ$ to -5$^\circ$ in galactic latitude. This region
covers the Carina Arm, the inter-arm region between the Perseus and Carina arms
and also a part of the Local Arm.
Observations were made using the YALO facilities at Cerro Tololo Inter-american
Observatory on 9 nights in April and May 2002. Images were taken with a
$2048\times2048$ Tek CCD attached to the 0.9-m telescope and the standard set of
\textit{UBVI} filters available at CTIO. The $0.39^{\prime\prime}$/px plate scale
resulted in a field of view of $13^\prime\times13^\prime$. Images were acquired
using the CTIO ARCON operating in Quad
mode\footnote{\url{http://www.ctio.noao.edu/instruments/arcon/arcon.html}}. The
CCD gain was set at 3.2 e$^-$/adu and the readout noise was determined to be
4.0 e$^-$.

A second series of CCD photometry was implemented during 2 nights (February and
March 2010) at Cerro Tololo Interamerican Observatory to get \textit{UBVI}
photometry in two other clusters, NGC 4349 and Lynga 15, at a slightly larger
galactic longitude (298$^\circ$). Images in a first run were taken with the CTIO
0.9-m telescope using a $2048\times2046$ px detector with a scale
$0.401^{\prime\prime}$/px covering thus $13.6^{\prime}$ on a side. A second run
of images taken at the 1.0 m telescope of the same clusters was carried out
with a $4064\times4064$ px CCD with a scale of $0.289^{\prime\prime}$/px thus
covering $20^\prime\times20^\prime$ on a side.
%
The first run (at the 0.9-m) was not photometric, and therefore we tied all
the images to the second night (at the 1.0-m), which was photometric. During
this second night, we took multiple images of the standard star fields PG 1047
and SA98 \citep{1992AJ....104..340L}, covering an air mass range $1.15-2.2$.

Details of exposure times per filter and telescope can be seen in Tables
\ref{tab:log_yalo} and \ref{tab:log_ctio} for the first and second series
respectively.\\

Short exposures were always obtained to avoid bright star saturation in the
frame. Notwithstanding, sometimes we could not help to lose very bright stars.
Finally, in the years of 2014 and 2015 the open cluster vdBH 73,
located at a smaller longitude ($\sim 273^\circ$) was observed in the 
\textit{UBVI} filters with the 1-m Swope telescope at Las Campanas Observatory,
Chile. On this occasion, direct images were acquired with the 4kx4k-4 CCD. All
observations were made under air mass ranges from $1.08$ to $1.092$ for 
\textit{U}, $1.072$ for \textit{B} and $1.077$ to $1.164$ for \textit{V} and

\subsection{Photometric reduction process}

The basic reduction of the CCD science frames has been done in the standard way
using the IRAF 4 package \texttt{ccdred}. The photometry was performed using
IRAF's DAOPHOT \citep{Stetson_1987,Stetson_1990} and \texttt{photcal} packages.
Aperture photometry was performed to obtain the instrumental magnitudes of
standard stars and some bright cluster stars. Profile-fitting photometry was
performed in each program frame by constructing the corresponding point spread
function. The zero-point of the instrumental magnitudes for each image was
determined with small-aperture photometry and growth curves.

The transformation equations to convert instrumental magnitudes into the
standard system were always of the form:

\begin{eqnarray*}
    u & = & U+u_1+u_2xX+u_3x(U-B) \\
    b & = & B+b_1+b_2xX+b_3x(B-V) \\
    v & = & V+v_1+v_2xX+v_3x(B-V) \\
    i & = & I+i_1+i_2xX+i_3x(V-I)
\end{eqnarray*}

where $u_2, b_2, v_2, i_2$ are the extinction coefficients computed for each
night and $X$ is the air-mass. In each case detector coordinates were
cross-matched with Gaia astrometry to convert pixels into
equatorial $\alpha$ and $\delta$ for the equinox J2000.0, thus providing
Gaia-based astrometry for the entire cluster catalog.\\

With the exception of the cluster NGC 4349, the rest of the objects in our
sample have no optical photometric studies so that no comparison with previous
photometry is possible. Notwithstanding we could perform a comparison of our
photometry in $V$ and $(B-V)$ with available photometry from APASS (The AAVSO
Photometric All-Sky Survey\footnote{\url{https://www.aavso.org/apass}}).
In this comparison we have put special care in those clusters belonging to the
observing runs in 2002 since they are for the most part very faint. Therefore
we performed a by-eye selection of well isolated stars to avoid light
contamination from nearby stars in APASS photometry. In each science frame we
have found between 12 and 21 stars in common with APASS, well distributed in
magnitude and colors.
In the particular case of van den Bergh-Hagen 73 we stated a comparison with
APASS data including a larger sample of stars in common (about 300 stars) and
the final results for $V$ and $(B-V)$ comparisons were of the same order.

Table \ref{tab:apass_diffs} shows the mean $\Delta V$ and $\Delta(B-V)$ results
for individual regions. Indeed differences in $V$ magnitudes were found within
reasonable values when comparing both sets of photometry. As for the
differences in the $(B-V)$ color index we found an even better agreement. This
fact makes us confident with the closeness of our photometry to the standard
photometric system.

\section{Photometric data analysis process: Gaia data and the \texttt{ASteCA}
code}
\label{sec:photom_analysis}

Given the large number of objects observed in this paper and regarding a
systematic, reproducible and homogeneous analysis the \texttt{ASteCA}
code\footnote{\url{http://asteca.github.io/}} is the optimal tool
to process our set of clusters. The main goal of this code is to put the user
apart, as much as possible, from the analysis of a stellar cluster to derive
its fundamental parameters. We shall limit ourselves to give a brief summary
about the way the positional and photometric data are employed by the code.
A complete description of the analysis carried out by
\texttt{ASteCA} can be found in \cite{Perren_2015} and \cite{Perren_2017}.
The starting point of this paper is that the region occupied by a real cluster
and the surrounding field should show ''a priori'' different properties. This
is, we should see an increase in the star density (not always true) where a
cluster is supposed to exist; the kinematics properties of cluster members
should differ from similar ones for the surrounding region; members of a
cluster must be at a same distance while non members may show all kind of
distances; the photometric diagrams composed by members of a cluster should
follow a well defined star sequence while field stars should not. 



% ---------------------------------------------------------------------
\subsection{Gaia data}
\label{ssec:gaia_data}

The second data release for the Gaia mission \citep{GaiaDR2_2018} was presented
on April 2018 with improved coverage, particularly for the five-parameter
astrometric solution.
% we were working on this article. Because of this, we could not incorporate the
% parallax data into the full analysis of our set of clusters as a new set of
% variables. Instead,
We crossed-match our complete set of photometric data with those of Gaia DR2
and employed Gaia's $G$ magnitude, parallax, and proper motions in our
analysis as described in Sect\ref{ssec:asteca_works}.

No ``a priori'' cut-off has been done on Gaia DR2 parallax or proper motion
data following the advice given in \cite{Luri_2018}. The parallax values were
processed with a Bayesian approach to get an independent estimate of the
distance to each cluster. In this approach, the model for the cluster is
taken from the accompanying tutorial by Bailer-Jones on inferring the distance
to a cluster via astrometry
data\footnote{\url{https://github.com/agabrown/astrometry-inference tutorials}}.
Our model marginalizes not only over the individual distances but also over the
shape parameter, estimating only the overall cluster distance using the
parallax value and its uncertainty for each star in the decontaminated cluster
region (see, please, the membership
probabilities process described in Sect.~\ref{ssec:asteca_works}).
The prior for the Bayesian model is a Gaussian centered at a maximum likelihood
estimate of the distance to the cluster region, with a large standard deviation
of 1 kpc and a cut-off for negative values. The results of this analysis will
be shown in a $Plx$ vs $G$ plot for each cluster in
Sect~\ref{sec:cluster_discuss}. We also performed the naive estimate of
obtaining the median of stars with parallax values greater than zero
and the weighted average values (where the weights are the inverse of the
parallax errors). 

%
%In general, the Bayesian distance estimates are larger than the photometric
%distances obtained with \texttt{ASteCA}. 

%We followed the advice given in 
%\cite{Lindegren_2018} and added 0.029 mas to the parallax values, since there
%is an offset in the zero point from Gaia DR2.

%Even after applying this offset,
%the distance estimates obtained from the Bayesian method and the parallax
%values are consistently larger than the photometric distances. The match
%improves applying instead the 0.054 mas and 0.075 mas offsets by
%\cite{Schonrich2019} and \cite{Xu_2019} respectively. This suggests that a potential
%local systematic quantity larger than $\sim0.05$ mas may be affecting Gaia DR2
%parallaxes.\\

We also include a two-sample Anderson-Darling
test,\footnote{\url{https://docs.scipy.org/doc/scipy/reference/generated/scipy.stats.anderson_ksamp.html}}
comparing the distribution of Gaia parallax and proper motions,
between the cluster and the estimated stellar field regions, to quantify how
``similar'' these two regions are among each other.
The results of the test in each case are indicated with AD and the
corresponding p-value\footnote{The null hypothesis ($H_{0}$) is the
hypothesis that the distributions of the two samples are drawn from the same
population. The significance level ($\alpha$) is the probability of mistakenly
rejecting the null hypothesis when it is true, also known as Type I error. The
p-value indicates the $\alpha$ with which we can reject $H_{0}$. The usual 5\%
significance level corresponds to an AD test value of 1.961, for the case of two
samples.}. The p-value indicates at what significance level the null hypothesis
can be rejected. This is, the smaller the p-value, the larger the probability
for the cluster region of being a true physical entity rather than a random
clustering of field stars. When using parallax and proper motions three
p-values are generated that are combined into a single p-value using Fisher's
combined probability
test\footnote{\url{https://docs.scipy.org/doc/scipy/reference/generated/scipy.stats.combine_pvalues.html}}.


%Since we use the parallax data and each proper motion dimension to obtain the
%Anderson-Darling test, this results in three different p-values for each
%cluster. These are combined into a single p-value using Fisher's combined
%probability
%test\footnote{\url{https://docs.scipy.org/doc/scipy/reference/generated/
% scipy.stats.combine_pvalues.html}}.


%where a small p-value means that we can safely reject the
%null hypothesis. Smaller p-values thus imply that the samples (cluster region vs
%field region) do not come from the same distribution, which means a larger
%probability for the cluster region of being a true physical entity rather than a
%random clustering of field stars.


%By way of example, one of the clusters with the largest combined p-value 
%(0.216) is vdB-Hagen 91, which means that it is the region less likely to
%contain a real star cluster (according to this statistical test based on
%parallax and proper motion data).



% ---------------------------------------------------------------------
\subsection{The way \texttt{ASteCA} works}
\label{ssec:asteca_works}

The several tasks performed by \texttt{ASteCA} can be roughly divided into three
main analysis blocks: structural study including the determination of a cluster
region identified primarily by an overdensity, individual membership probability
estimation for stars inside the overdensity, and the search for the best fit
parameters.\\

The first block estimates center and radius values 
that define in each case the cluster region. Robust estimations
of these two quantities can only be achieved when a clear overdensity and a
large number of members are detected. If a cluster is not
clearly defined as an overdensity on the observed frame and if its boundaries are
weakly established, \texttt{ASteCA} allows center and radius to be manually
fixed since the automatic procedure may return incorrect values. We had to
proceed like this in several clusters structurally sparse and with a low number
of members.  King profile fittings have been performed in those cases when a
fit could be generated. No formal core or tidal radius are given because their
values, due mainly to the shape of the radial density profile (hereafter RDP),
were not within reasonable estimates.

Every point of the RDP was obtained by generating ``square rings'' around the
center defined for the potential cluster, i.e.: the comparison field.
% We use ``square rings'' combining two-dimension bins since this geometry
% facilitates the analysis, particularly when the potential cluster is near the
% edge of the observed frame.
In the present case the comparison field may contain between 1 and 10 regions
of equal area to that of the cluster, depending on the cluster area and the
available size of the remaining of the frame.
In each ring the found number of stars is divided by the respective area
to get a value of the radial density. For the computation of the density
level of the field (foreground/background), outliers in the RDP are iteratively
discarded to avoid biasing the final value. This procedure is repeated until
converging to an equilibrium value, equivalent to the density of the star field
at a given distance from the potential cluster center.\\

The second block assigns membership probabilities, an
usually disregarded process in simpler cluster studies. By itself, an
over-density does not mean the presence of a real cluster; many times an
overdensity is confused with random fluctuations in the field star density. To
avoid such a mistake a comparison of the photometric
properties for cluster and field stars must be done. Eventually, we
look for a firm evidence of the presence of a cluster sequence at some
evolutionary status. \texttt{ASteCA} employs a Bayesian algorithm to 
compare the photometric, parallax, and proper motions distribution of the stars
in the cluster region with a similar distribution in the surrounding field
areas \citep{Perren_2015}. In the present case, the analysis is carried out in 
an N-dimensional data space (N = 7, $G$ magnitude; $(V-I)$, $(B-V)$, $(U-B)$
colors; parallax; and proper motions).
%
Briefly, the algorithm compares the properties of the N-dimensional data space
for stars inside and outside the adopted cluster limits.
The position of every star inside the cluster in this data space
is compared against each star in all the defined equivalent-area field regions,
assuming a Gaussian probability density (centered at the given values for each
data dimension, with standard deviations given by the respective
uncertainties). This procedure is repeated hundreds or thousands of times 
(defined by the user) each time selecting different stars to construct an
approximation of the clean cluster region. The outcoming result of this
algorithm are thousands of probability values that are averaged to a final and
single membership probability value for each star within the cluster region.

This block ends with the cleaning of the photometric
diagrams in the cluster region. Each photometric diagram is then divided into
cells and similarly for the equivalent diagram of the field. The star density
number found in the field is then subtracted from the
cluster photometric diagram, cell by cell, starting with stars having low
membership probabilities. Therefore, the final cluster photometric diagrams
contain not only star membership assignation but it is also cleaned from the
expected field star contamination. This two-step process is of the utmost
importance to ensure that the fundamental parameters analysis is performed on
the best possible approximation to the cluster sequence (particularly when
the cluster contains few members).\\

Finally, the third block performs the cluster's parameters estimation through
the minimization of a likelihood function \citep{Dolphin_2002} employing a
genetic algorithm numerical optimization \citep{Charbonneau_1995}. This last
stage includes the assignment of uncertainties for each fitted parameter via a
standard bootstrap method \citep{efron1986}. Again, all of these processes are
described in much more detail in \cite{Perren_2015} and \cite{Perren_2017}.

It is worth noting that, unlike other tools \citep[e.g.:][]{Yen_2018},
\texttt{ASteCA} does not fit isochrones to cluster sequences in photometric
diagrams. Instead, it fits two or three-dimensional synthetic
clusters in color-magnitude diagrams (depending on the number of photometric
colors available) generated from a set of theoretical isochrones, a given
initial mass function, and completeness and uncertainties functions estimated
directly from the observations. The ``best fit'' isochrones shown in green in
the respective photometric diagrams are there for convenience purposes only, as
a way to guide the eye.

Let us mention in this instance that the code makes use
of the PARSEC v1.2S \citep{Bressan_2012} theoretical isochrones (obtained from
the CMD service\footnote{\url{http://stev.oapd.inaf.it/cgi-bin/cmd}}), and the
\cite{Kroupa_2002} form for the initial mass function. The full processing
yields five parameters: metallicity, age, extinction,
distance, and mass, along with their respective uncertainties. The binary
fraction was always fixed to 0.3, a reasonable
estimate for open clusters \citep{Sollima_2010}. As for the final mass of every
cluster, it was corrected by effects of star loss at large magnitudes, but the
dynamical mass loss due to the cluster's orbiting through the Galaxy was not.
Hence, it should be regarded as the present day mass value, and not the total
initial mass value. 

From a practical point of view the code proceeds as follows to get the
cluster's parameters. Firstly, individual three dimensional $G$ vs $(B-V)$ vs $
(U-B)$ photometric diagrams are analyzed fixing the metallicity to a solar
value ($z = 0.0152$) in order to reduce the dimensionality of the parameter
space, and thus its complexity. Although several of the aforementioned diagrams
contain, in the present case, a rather small number of stars due to the
presence of the $U$ filter, they are very useful to get reddening and thus
extinction via the inspections of the $(U-B)$ vs $(B-V)$ diagrams
\citep{Vazquez2008} .
% Only in five cases (vdBH 73, vdBH 85, vdBH 106, NGC 4230, and RUP 88) the
% number of stars remaining in the photometric diagrams
% was too small when the $U$ filter was included.
The individual $E(B-V)$ values in each region were always checked against
maximum values given by the \cite{Schlafly_2011} maps\footnote{Through the
NASA/IPAC service \url{https://irsa.ipac.caltech.edu/applications/DUST/}}.
Actually, the only information extracted from this first step and in particular
by inspection of the $(U-B)$ vs $(B-V)$ diagram is a reasonable range for
the $E(B-V)$ parameter.
%
Secondly, the analysis of the $G$ vs $(B-V)$ vs $(V-I)$ diagram is carried out
restricting now the reddening space to the $E(B-V)$ range obtained previously,
while still fixing the metallicity to solar value. We get from this process
estimates for the age, distance, and cluster mass.
%
Finally, in a third stage the parameter ranges derived above are retaken but
now including the metallicity as a free parameter. As a result of the entire
procedure, we obtain a five parameter best model fit for each observed cluster,
along with the associated one sigma uncertainties for each one. In all the
cases we have adopted $R=A_v/E(B-V) = 3.1$ to produce corrected distance moduli.

After all the processing is done, each observed cluster was finally compared to
around $\sim2\times10^7$ synthetic clusters.

\section{Cluster-by-cluster discussion on structural and intrinsic parameters
provided by \texttt{ASteCA}}
\label{sec:cluster_discuss}

We show next the results provided by the spatial and photometric analysis
carried out with \texttt{ASteCA}, together with the outcome of the application
of the Anderson-Darling test that compares parallax and proper motion
distributions in the cluster regions and its respective field regions.
It is important to emphasize that the code will always fit the
best possible synthetic cluster to a given star distribution, no matter if we
face a true open cluster or not.
% With this in mind, for each cluster studied in Sect.~\ref{sec:cluster_discuss}
% we provide the best possible fitting, be it a cluster or not.

Observation and analysis results for each cluster are depicted with four
figures. The first of them shows the photometric diagrams built with
all the stars observed in the region where a cluster is supposed to exist,
according to the literature.
The second figure represents the spatial analysis carried out by
\texttt{ASteCA}. This is: results from the search of an stellar overdensity, the
mean value for the stellar field, the respective King profile\footnote{We
recall that in the present investigation given the small number of members in
each cluster and the particular geometry of these objects, the King profile
fitting is of no relevance.} attempting to fit the radial density profile, and
the assumed radius.
The third figure introduces the ``clean'' color-color $(U-B)$ vs $(B-V)$ and
the field decontaminated color-magnitude diagrams, $G$ vs $(B-V)$ and $G$ vs $
(V-I)$ (from now on CCD and CMDs respectively), made with stars having
membership probabilities provided by \texttt{ASteCA}. We insert in the
mid panel of this last figure, the color-color diagram, the results from the
best synthetic cluster fitting to the field decontaminated diagrams. In these
three panels we show as well the isochrone curves from which the best
synthetic cluster fit was generated. Again, this is just to guide the eye since
\texttt{ASteCA} does not fit isochrones.
%
The fourth figure, finally, includes three panels. The left one shows the
$G$ mag vs parallax values (uncertainties indicated by horizontal bars) of
cluster members, colored according to the estimated membership probabilities 
(colorbar to the right). 

%
The Bayesian distance ($d_{Bayes}$) found by the code is shown by a vertical
blue dashed line, the equivalent \texttt{ASteCA} distance ($d_{ASteCA}$) with a
green dotted line, the weighted average with a red dashed line and the naive
estimate of obtaining the median of stars with parallax values greater than
zero with black dashed line.
%
The mid panel in this fourth figure is the kernel density estimate (KDE) of
stars in the surrounding field region and the cluster region, in black and red
lines respectively. For the Anderson-Darling test we used all the
stars within the cluster region with Gaia data. In the right panel we
summarize the distances in parsecs and errors, ($d_{Bayes}$)
and $d_{ASteCA}$, followed by the corresponding parallax
value, $Plx$, and corrected distance modulus, $\mu_0$. Both
fittings are indicated by the vertical blue and green dashed lines. The final
four text lines in the right panel are the AD values for $Plx$, $PM(\alpha)$,
$PM(\delta)$ from the Anderson-Darling test, followed by the corresponding
$p$-values and finally the combined $p$-value.\\

Our sample contains clusters with a large variety of properties: some are
robust, bright, well detached from the cluster background and therefore with a
clearly defined main sequence, others are clusters which are faint, with sparse
star population and easy to confuse with the background. Therefore, given the
anomalous amount of figures to be shown in this paper we decided to add them to
an electronic Appendix to save space, and limited ourselves here to present the
case of two extreme types of cluster according to the statement above: a poorly
defined (vdBH 73), a well-defined (NGC 4349) and a not cluster 
(RUP 87).

    \label{fig6}
\end{figure*}

The cluster vdBH 73 is placed in almost the center of the Vela
constellation well at the northeast border of the Carina Constellation. The
visual chart of the region in Fig. \ref{fig2} shows a small and compact grouping
of stars at the very center of the frame surrounded by a dense stellar field.
However, the inspection of the CCD and CMDs for all the observed stars in
Fig. \ref{fig3} gives no hints about the presence of a
cluster there. Basically, there are in the CMDs of Fig. \ref{fig3} few stars
above $V=15$ mag but at larger magnitudes the CMDs strongly widen surely due to
the presence of increasing visual absorption. In fact, the reddening in the
CCD, right panel in Fig. \ref{fig3}, is quite strong and displaces the bulk of
stars entirely toward the red side. Even some blue stars with negative $(U-B)$
values appear strongly affected by variable reddening.\\

The \texttt{ASteCA} spatial data processing shows a pronounced star overdensity
of 2.5 arcmin radius in the left panel in Fig. \ref{fig4} coincident with the
location expected for vdBH 73. This overdensity appears very well
detached from the field star mean density as seen in the RDP to the right.
Notice that the density peak is about five times above the mean for the field.\\

In the following step the removal of field interlopers by comparison with the
background field properties yielded the clean diagrams for all stars with
membership probability above 0.46 which are shown in Fig. \ref{fig5}. The clean
CMDs, left and right panels, put in evidence a cluster main sequence subtending
1.5 magnitudes and a faint giant branch with stars up to $V=15$ mag. The clean
CCD in the middle panel shows only a handful of stars with no clear locus
defined. All these stars have membership probabilities between 0.46 and 0.93
favoring thus the true nature of this object. This is: such a level of
probability suggests that stars in the adopted cluster region are --for the
most part-- well detached, in terms of their photometric characteristics and
spatial distribution, from those belonging to the cluster surroundings and
therefore with low chance to be confused with the stellar field. The best
fitting of a synthetic cluster yields the following facts:

\begin{itemize}
\item [a)] The cluster is immersed in a region of moderate absorption since the
mean of reddening comes to be $E(B-V) = 0.62$, a value compatible with the
ones provided by \cite{Schlafly_2011} (hereafter S\&F2011) who
found a maximum $E(B-V)$ of about 1.2 mag towards vdBH 73.
\item [b)] The absorption-free distance modulus turns out to be 12.1 placing
this object at 2.6 kpc from the Sun.
\end{itemize}

From the photometric point of view the existence of a well outlined cluster main
sequence and the high probability memberships of the stars seen in it confirm
the real entity of vdBH 73. However, the usage of parallax data
from Gaia, see Fig. \ref{fig6}, shows a huge difference in distance reaching
up 2.7 kpc in the sense that Gaia parallaxes place the cluster farther than
photometry does. This difference improves when offset is applied to the
parallax data, as shown in Sect. \ref{sec:results_concl}.
The Anderson-Darling test applied to parallax and proper motion
data demonstrates that the null hypothesis can indeed be rejected, pointing to
a real cluster present in this region.\\

We conclude from our analysis that van den Bergh 73 is an old cluster around
$6\times10^9$ years old.

This is a Crux constellation object, placed slightly south of the Crux geometric
center. At first glance, the $V$ image in Fig. \ref{fig2} shows a
distinguishable star accumulation. The overall photometric CCD and CMDs in
Fig.~\ref{fig63} show a prominent star sequence emerging at $V=16$ mag from the
usual stellar structure produced by disc stars. The CCD makes more evident the
presence of a reddened but compact sequence of blue stars placed immediately
below the first knee of the intrinsic line. Apart from this, other bluer stars
appear for $(U-B)$ values smaller than 0.0.\\ 

\texttt{ASteCA} analysis revealed an extended overdensity of up to 20 stars per
square arcmin reflected by a prominent but a tiny RDP with a radius of 4.5
arcmin depicted in the panels of Fig. \ref{fig64}.
The \texttt{ASteCA} estimation of memberships shows that inside the adopted
cluster radius the probability values go from 0.41 to 1.0 in the respective
CCD and CMDs of Fig. \ref{fig65}. So, it is clear that probable members of the
cluster detach easily from the field region stars photometric properties. If
attention is drawn to the largest probabilities (say above 0.7, starting in
light blue symbols) there appears in the three diagrams a somewhat narrow
cluster. Comparison with synthetic clusters yielded that NGC 4349 is a cluster
with the following properties:

\begin{itemize}
    \item [a)] A color excess of $E(B-V)= 0.40$ is found for the best fitting
    synthetic cluster. Since the maximum color excess provided by
    S\&F2011 in this location is 2.83 one concludes that most of the
    absorption is produced behind the position of NGC 4349.
    \item [b)] The absorption free distance modulus of NGC 4349 is 12.2,
    placing it at a distance of $d=2.75$ kpc from the Sun. 
\end{itemize}

NGC 4349 is the only cluster in our sample with previous photographic photometry
in the $UBV$ system performed by \cite{Lohmann_1961}. Given the usual large
differences between photographic and CCD photometry we performed no comparison
between the Lohmann data-set and ours. According to \cite{Lohmann_1961}, NGC
4349 is located at a distance of $d=1.7$ kpc, far enough from our estimate.
However, coincidences in terms of reddening, size and background star density
have been found since Lohmann stated a cluster reddening of $E(B-V)=0.38$
and similar cluster size. On the other hand, the Kharchenko
Atlas\footnote{\url{https://webda.physics.muni.cz/cocd.html}}
\citep{Kharchenko_2005} gives a reddening value of $E(B-V) = 0.38$ quite
similar to ours although the distance reported, $d=2.1$ kpc, is slightly below
our estimate.
It is worth noting that the distance found for this cluster using Gaia
parallax data with no applied offset, processed with the Bayesian method
described in Sect.~\ref{ssec:gaia_data}, is lower than the photometric
distance found by \texttt{ASteCA}, 2.23 kpc, and gets lower as larger offsets
are applied.

Parallax and proper motion distributions were tested using the Anderson-Darling
statistics. With the exception of the comparison in the case of $PM(\delta)$
(where both samples, cluster and field, seem to come from the same distribution
at a critical value just above 5\%) the remaining two tests report quite
different samples confirming, together with the photometric results, the true
nature of NGC 4349.\\

High probability values for stars inside the overdensity confirm the
true nature of this object since the over density and the density profile
are followed by a very well defined and extended photometric counterpart.
Since all these facts are self-consistent, we are confident that NGC 4349 is
an open cluster around $396\times10^6$ years old.
The Kharchenko Atlas gives quite a similar value for the cluster age, reporting
$\log(t)=8.32$ equivalent to $209\times10^6$ yrs.

\subsection{Ruprecht 87}

    \caption{Idem Fig. \ref{fig6} for RUP 87.}
    \label{fig26}
\end{figure*}

RUP 87 is in the east side of the Vela constellation. According to the
respective Fig. \ref{fig2} there is no relevant feature but a rather poor and
boring stellar field. The first glance impression is confirmed in the
photometric diagrams since no appreciable stellar structure
defining the presence of an open cluster is present in the overall CMDs of Fig.
\ref{fig23}. The few stars with $(U-B)$ measures plotted in the respective
color-color magnitude resemble a typical CCD of a galactic field dominated by a
handful of late $F$ and $G$-type stars followed by a pronounced tail of red
stars presumably of evolved types. Perhaps stars in the region $0<(U-B)<0.5$
and $0<(B-V)<0.6$ are reddened early $A$ or/and late $B$-types.\\

Accordingly, after many essays \texttt{ASteCA} could not define the presence of
an overdensity as obviously seen in Fig. \ref{fig24}. The inability of our code
to identify any overdensity simply means that the potential locus occupied by
the cluster RUP 87 is not unambiguously separated from the field background
stars. So, after many attempts to state the place of the cluster we decide to
focus the attention in the region encircled by a green line. However, the RDP
emerging from this analysis is not only quite noisy but it is hard to establish
the mean value of the background density. Notice that only 28 stars remain in
the region adopted. The estimation of the memberships and the not so clear clean
CCD and CMDs in Fig. \ref{fig25} reflects the difficulty since stars inside the
adopted cluster area have membership values ranging from 0.34 to 0.81 so that
a significant portion of those may also belong to the surrounding field.\\

As seen in Fig. \ref{fig26} the Anderson-Darling test values for $Plx$ and
proper motions do not confirm clear differences between the cluster region and
the stellar background in terms of kinematics and distance. The poverty of the
photometric diagrams and the analysis of Gaia data are all against the true
existence of a cluster in the region RUP 87. In our interpretation this is
not a real entity but a fluctuation of the star field.





%================================================================
\section{Gaia parallax distances analysis}
\label{sec:gaia_distances}


We shall close our analysis by taking a look at the matter of distances yielded
by \texttt{ASteCA} and those that can be obtained using parallaxes alone.
Specifically, we cross-matched $Plx$ data with our photometry, cluster by
cluster, and next we processed them within a Bayesian framework. The intention
is only to visualize the change in distances, if no bias is applied to the
parallaxes and when current values taken from the literature are used. The
results of the exercise are included in the last 4 columns of Table 
\ref{tab:final_tab}. It is evident that \texttt{ASteCA} distances are almost
systematically smaller than the ones coming from the computation of parallax
alone. The exceptions are NGC 4349, and vdBH 106 which show smaller photometric
distances (particularly vdBH 106). The situation is more clearly shown in Fig. 
\ref{fig:prlxnobias}  (top) with a plot of \texttt{ASteCA} distances against
those obtained from parallaxes, with no bias applied.

\begin{figure}[ht]
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=\hsize]{../figs/dist_comparision2.png}
    \caption{Top: \texttt{ASteCA} (photometric) vs Bayesian (parallax)
    distances for the 10 clusters listed in Table~\ref{tab:final_tab}. No bias
    correction applied to parallax data.
    Bottom: offset (\texttt{ASteCA} - Bayes) for distances expressed
    as parallax. Colorbar to the right indicates $\log(age)$ values.}
    \label{fig:prlxnobias}
\end{figure}

If we add 0.029, 0.054, 0.075 mas offsets to the parallax data, according to
\cite{Lindegren_2018}, \cite{Schonrich2019}, and
\cite{Xu_2019} respectively, the agreement between \texttt{ASteCA} and
parallax distances improves as shown in Fig. \ref{fig:prlxbias}.
%
The mean differences between photometric distances 
and parallax distances are of $\sim-0.35$ kpc,
$\sim-0.03$ kpc, and $\sim0.21$ kpc, using the above bias corrections. Some
way, this tends to confirm that the parallaxes need a bias correction larger
than the proposed by Lindegren et al.
%
As for the two clusters that show no good agreement between photometric and
parallax distances with either bias correction, vdBH 73 and van den Bergh-Hagen
106, let us comment that vdBH 73 is well defined but faint while vdBH 106 shows
a very dispersed sequence in its CMD.
%
If we repeat the mean computation leaving out these two clusters, the above
values change to $\sim-0.40$ kpc, $\sim-0.92$ kpc, and $\sim0.11$ kpc, again
for Lindegren et al., Sch\"onrich et al., and Xu et al. respectively. This
analysis points to a required bias correction to Gaia parallax data between
those of Sch\"onrich and Xu et al. If we look at Fig~\ref{fig:prlxnobias} 
(bottom) we will see that the offset found when comparing with parallax
distances obtained with no bias applied, is around $\sim0.07$ mas, thus closest
to the value given by Xu et al.

\begin{figure*}[ht]
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=\hsize]{../figs/dist_comparision1.png}
    \caption{\texttt{ASteCA} (photometric) vs Bayesian (parallax) distances for
    the present sample, with bias corrections from Lindegren et al. (left),
    Sch\"onrich et al. (center), and Xu et al. (right). Error bars are
    indicated along with the cluster names. The mean of differences between
    ASteCA and others distances is shown on top of the figures. Colorbar to
    the right indicates $\log(age)$ values.}
    \label{fig:prlxbias}
\end{figure*}

We are aware that the discrepancies between parallax and \texttt{ASteCA}
distances may surely obey to additional reasons that must be taken into
consideration. On one hand, \texttt{ASteCA} does not look for the value of $R$ 
(ratio between visual absorption and color excess, fixed at $R=3.1$) and it is
known that variations in $R$ can modify distances and ages. However, this is
not enough explanation since the impact on distance may be quite appreciable
only among young clusters, but not necessarily among the older ones. The value
of the computed color excess is another source of uncertainty. 
Despite \texttt{ASteCA} determines this quantity using the $U-B$ index in each
case -a fact that reduces mistakes- it still has some degree of difficulty in
estimating parameters of very young clusters because their main sequences are
appreciably vertical introducing then large fit uncertainties especially in
clusters with few members. This could explain the great difference with the
Gaia distance in the case of RUP 162 (added to the fact that this one, in
particular, may not be a real cluster). But on the other hand, \texttt{ASteCA}
fits more precisely those clusters where there is a well defined main sequence
followed by a not ambiguous turn-off point, such as the case of vdBH 85. And
yet the differences between \texttt{ASteCA} and parallax distances for this
object is among the largest, when no offset is applied. Certainly, a more
extended sample of clusters is needed to get conclusive results and establish
the distance at which our code and parallaxes distances start diverging. 




%================================================================
\section{Discussion of results and concluding remarks}
\label{sec:results_concl}

In the precedent sections we have analyzed the fields of sixteen potential
open clusters located in a Galaxy sector covering from $290^\circ$ to
$320^\circ$ approximately in galactic longitude, and mostly close to the formal
galactic plane at $b=0^\circ$.
The cluster parameter estimations presented in this article are based on
precise $UBVI$ photometry analyzed in a automatic way by
our code \texttt{ASteCA}. The code searches for a meaningful stellar overdensity
assigning membership probabilities by comparison with the surrounding stellar
field.
The next step establishes the physical properties of the best synthetic cluster
that fits the distribution of cluster members in the CMDs and the CCD.
Through this process reddening, distance, age, mass, and metallicity are
given.
The most relevant inconvenient we have found with the present cluster
sample resides in the fact that they are extremely faint, which becomes evident
by visual inspection in the overall CCD and CMD.
Things get more difficult because the $(U-B)$ index has been mostly available for
the bright and blue stars which reduced considerably the data analysis space.
Despite this we were able to keep the reddening solutions under control and
obtain reliable distances estimations for those objects found true clusters by
our code. This way, we can safely reject RUP 87, vdBH91, RUP 88, Lynga 15,
Loden 565 and NGC 4230 that are most probably random stellar fluctuations. The
results for true and probable open clusters are shown in Table 
\ref{tab:final_tab} in self-explicative format.

An interesting data provided by \texttt{ASteCA} analysis is the
metal content $z$ for each cluster included in the third column of Table 
\ref{tab:final_tab}. If we average the found values including all the clusters
the metal content is $z=0.0153$ with a standard deviation $\sigma = 0.009$.
Therefore the result is well in agreement with modern adopted values for solar
metallicity as expected in most of open clusters placed along the galactic
plane.\\

Of the remaining ten objects, three are probable clusters with distances going
from 1.8 to over 6 kpc. Ages of clusters sweep from a few million years to
almost 10 billions in the case of vdBH 106. But this last is just a probable
open cluster so that its age should be taken with care. vdBH 73 and vdBH 85 are
also two old objects of 6 and 7.4 billion years. In these cases we are
confident with the true nature of them. Three others  vdBH 92, TR 13 and RUP
162 are young with ages under 100 million years while the rest are all less
than 1 billion years old.

That only three clusters are quite young to be taken as potential spiral arm
tracers is a frustrating result. Indeed less is to be said about the spiral
structure with a so small sample. Anyway we plotted all the clusters in 
\ref{fig68} in the X-Y and X-Z planes with spiral arms taken from 
\cite{v2005AJ} where it is seen that RUP 162 and TR 13  are placed along the in
the external side of the Carina arm. Particularly, at the distances of RUP 162
and TR 13 they appear below the Galaxy plane (-0.1 and -0.2 kpc) thus
accompanying the warp of this arm already mentioned by, among others, 
\cite{Cersosimo_2009}. The third young (and dubious) cluster, vdBH 162, is
relatively far from the Carina arm in an intermediate zone between this and the
Sun. Looking at \ref{fig68} there is no trace of the Perseus arm.

\caption{The symbol ``*'' indicates probable clusters. The $d_{Bayes}$ values

\end{table*}

We can also conclude that by adding $\sim0.07$ mas to the cluster computed
parallaxes from Gaia DR2 parallax data, the level of agreement with the
photometric distances is reasonable.
For other objects the gap between photometric and parallax distances narrows
when a smaller offset is applied instead, but the decision of
adding either quantity becomes somewhat arbitrary. Our cluster sample is not
large enough to permit us drawing stronger conclusions on this regard.\\

\appendix

The thirteen clusters in this Appendix are ordered according to their right
ascension, as shown in Table \ref{tab:clust_list}. The remaining three analyzed
clusters were presented in Sect. \ref{sec:cluster_discuss}.

%================================================================
\section{Ruprecht 85}

Ruprech 85 belongs to the south side of the Vela Constellation close to the
border of the Carina region. This cluster appears in Fig. \ref{fig2} as a slight
increment in the stellar field towards the north part in the respective frame.
The overall stars photometric diagrams as shown in Fig. \ref{fig7} do not show
the presence of any cluster sequence but a vertical strip of stars emerging from
a poorly populated stellar field above $V= 14$ mag defined by disk stars.\\

The structural analysis performed by \texttt{ASteCA} yields a clean overdensity
at the location of this object that appears subtending an almost circular area
of 3 arcmins radius, Fig. \ref{fig8} left panel. As shown in the Fig. \ref{fig8}
right panel, the RDP is well developed, scarcely noisy and with a star density
five times above the background level. The photometric diagrams, CCD and CMDs of
stars with membership probabilities above 0.74 and up to 1.0 shown in Fig.
\ref{fig9} depict a main sequence sweeping 3.5 magnitudes. Intermediate
probability members are found around the giant branch but we suggest that
care should be taken with this fact. Combining structural evidences with
evidences coming from the photometric diagrams we conclude that RUP 85 is a
real entity. As for the cluster parameters of the best synthetic cluster
fitting the observations it is found that:

\begin{itemize}
\item [a)] Like in the case of vdBH 73, RUP 85 is also placed
    in a region of moderate color excess. In fact the cluster has $E(B-V) =
    1.06$ also entirely in line with a maximum $E(B-V)$ of 1.9 according to 
    S\&F2011.
\item [b)] The free absorption distance modulus is 13.5 mag corresponding to a
    distance $d=5.01$ kpc.
\end{itemize}

The results from the Anderson-Darling test in Fig. \ref{fig10} applied to $Plx$,
$PM(\alpha)$ and $PM(\delta)$ indicate clearly that the cluster region and the
surrounding background population come from quite different star populations.
Therefore, the null hypothesis can be rejected.\\

We conclude that RUP 85 is a real open cluster over $0.41\times10^9$ yr old.

%================================================================
\section{van den Bergh-Hagen 85}

vdBH 85 appears in the sky slightly east of the center of the
Vela constellation. The $V$ chart in Fig. \ref{fig2} shows a weak star
concentration near the north side of the observed field extending a little bit
to the south east. The photometric diagrams of the entire field of view is just
a dispersed star distribution ending in a compact accumulation at $(B-V)=1$ and
below $V = 17$ mag approximately. Another clear feature in the two CMDs is a
structure at $V = 16$ and for $1.2 < (B-V) < 1.7$ resembling a red clump.\\

\texttt{ASteCA} detected an overdensity very well detached from the stellar
background reflected in the smooth RDP in Fig. \ref{fig12} contained in a circle
2.8 arcmins radius and more than five times the background density. Once the
removal of field interlopers is done and the membership probabilities are
established the two CMDs of all stars with probabilities above 0.58 show a
short but evident main sequence below $G=17$ mag.
Three magnitudes above the cluster turn-off, at $G=14$ mag a handful of stars
appear, possibly part of the bright end of the giant branch. Also at
$G=14$ mag and almost located at the center of the CMDs, a couple of stars with
MPs around 0.8 could be classified as blue stragglers associated to van den
Bergh-Hagen 85.
The comparison with the best fitting of a synthetic cluster throws the
following characteristics for vdBH 85:

\begin{itemize}
\item [a)] the cluster is seen projected against a stellar field with moderate
    to low color excess. The best value corresponds to $E(B-V) = 0.28$ in
    correspondence with the maximum value of 0.45 stated by S\&F2011.
\item [b)] The free absorption distance modulus of vdBH 85 is
    13.1 mag which implies a distance of 4.17 kpc from the Sun. This fact
    explains by itself the extreme weakness of cluster members.
\end{itemize}

The Anderson-Darling test results in Fig. \ref{fig14} suggest the null
hypothesis can be safely rejected. In fact, $Plx$, $PM(\alpha)$ and
$PM(\delta)$ results from the Anderson-Darling test leave no doubt in the sense
that cluster region and the surrounding comparison field come from quite
different star populations.\\

We conclude that this object is a real and very old cluster, approximately
$7.4\times10^9$ yrs old.

%================================================================
\section{van den Bergh-Hagen 87}

Like RUP 85, vdBH 87 is seen toward the south of Vela Constellation close to
the border with Carina. A weak grouping of stars placed towards the north of
the frame is seen in Fig. \ref{fig2}. In turn, the CMDs in Fig. \ref{fig15}
seem to reflect a typical star disk sequence up to $V = 15$ mag approximately
with an amorphous distribution at the bright end. The CCD is, on the other
side, rather poor.\\

A stellar overdensity reaching $\sim20$ times the field star density is
seen in Fig. \ref{fig16}. The spatial structure of this overdensity suggests an
elongation in right ascension and a RDP characterized by a very narrow density
peak followed by a star coronal distribution at about 2 arcmins from the center.
The clean CMDs in Fig. \ref{fig17} leave no doubt as for the nature of van den
Bergh-Hagen 87 since inside this overdensity a robust and narrow cluster main
sequence is evident. Its sequence extends for more than 5 mag in the
CMDs, including stars with membership probabilities in the range from 0.80 to
1. The CCD no the other hand does not show a clear cluster sequence.
The parameters of the synthetic cluster that best fits the real star
distributions are:

\begin{itemize}
\item [a)] The color excess is $E(B-V) = 0.58$ indicating thus a moderate
    absorption in the cluster direction. In turn, this color excess value is
    below the maximum reddening $E(B-V) = 2.9$ computed in the region for 
    S\&F2011.
\item [b)] The corrected distance modulus is 11.3 implying a distance of $d =
    1.9$ kpc. The cluster is not far from the Sun and this closeness explains
    the moderate color excess found.
\end{itemize}

The results of the application of the Anderson-Darling test in Fig. \ref{fig18}
are coincident with what \texttt{ASteCA} have found. This is that cluster and
field regions are quite different not only from the photometric perspective but
also from a kinematic view.\\

In conclusion vdBH 87 is a real open cluster about $0.32\times10^9$ years old.

\section{Trumpler 12}

This object is placed in the west side of the Carina HII region where it appears
as a sparse handful of bright stars in Fig. \ref{fig2}. The CMDs in Fig.
\ref{fig19}, including all stars in the region, show the following patterns:
there is a wide grouping of stars below $V = 18$ mag but to the right side of
it, and also at this magnitude value, a narrow structure of stars up to $V= 14$
mag slightly displaced to the blue side emerges. From $V = 18$ mag a typical
vertical galactic disk population rises too.\\

\texttt{ASteCA} detected a main overdensity and other less relevant ones shown
in Fig. \ref{fig20}. The reader can note a quite noisy RDP, a fact explained in
part because at the peak of the RDP there is less than twice the density of the
background. Under this condition is not an easy task to fix an appropriate
radius for the overdensity. We tentatively adopt 3 arcmin radius as a reasonable
compromise. The membership probabilities in the zone of the overdensity range
from 0.50 to 0.97 as indicated in Fig. \ref{fig21}. We draw the attention to
the fact that only 142 stars were detected inside the potential cluster zone.
%
There exists a clear difficulty to separate field stars from cluster
members, reflected in the noisy distribution visible in the CMDs. For $G<16$
mag some stars describe roughly a cluster main sequence.
In particular some of them belonging to the tiny blue and narrow
sequence detected easily in the diagrams of Fig. \ref{fig19} form part
(including the turn-off stars) of the clean sequence between $V = 12$ and $V =
16$ mag seen in Fig. \ref{fig21}. Comparison with synthetic clusters is still
possible and the properties of the best fit achieved in the present case are the
next:

\begin{itemize}
\item [a)] A color excess of $E(B-V) = 0.29$ is found for the best fitting.
    Since the maximum color excess provided by S\&F2011 is 0.50 we found a
    precedent result and in case TR 12 is a real cluster it is placed in a
    zone of low absorption.
\item [b)] The absorption free distance modulus becomes 12.4 representing a
    distance of 3.02 kpc. At such a distance and with low absorption it is
    reasonable to find a high background stellar density as seen in Fig. 
    \ref{fig20}.
\end{itemize}

From the Anderson-Darling statistics shown in Fig. \ref{fig21} we see that
proper motions for the cluster and for the field population belong to different
samples. On the other hand, the parallaxes can not be safely separated into
distinct stellar regions.\\

The noisy profile that does not allow establishing a clear cluster extension
and the poor main sequence requires us to be cautious. More deep photometry
($(U-B)$ particularly) is needed to achieve a precise result as for the true
nature of this object. Meanwhile we conclude that TR 12 is a dubious cluster
about $0.8\times10^9$ years old.

\section{van den Bergh-Hagen 91}

vdBH 91 is a potential cluster at the west side of Carina HII
region, specifically near the northern border of this constellation with Vela.
No relevant stellar structure appears in the $V$ image of Fig. \ref{fig2} but a
common pattern of a galactic field star near the galactic plane. The overall
CMDs in Fig. \ref{fig27} show a stellar sequence that, at first sight, resemble
the usual diagrams for open clusters. In turn, the CCD
is dominated by a tail of $F$- and $G$-type stars prolonged by red stars. It is
noticed as well the presence of some reddened early type stars for negative
$(U-B)$ indices.\\

\texttt{ASteCA} found two well separated stellar overdensity peaks in Fig.
\ref{fig28} whose relevance in terms of stellar density is barely important
since they include no more than three stars above the background density. The
noisy RDP proves by itself the poverty of the entire field surveyed in term of
star number. After some attempts looking for a cluster sequence we ask
\texttt{ASteCA} to estimate the probabilities for stars inside an adopted radius
of 3.6 arcmin shown in Fig. \ref{fig28} right. As seen in Fig. \ref{fig29}
almost one hundred stars inside the circle associated to vdBH 91 were
found in the CMDs with membership probabilities ranging from 0.43 to 0.80.
It is interesting that most stars with lower probabilities outline a fictitious
sequence below $G=16$ mag in these diagrams while stars with higher
probabilities are scattered between the location of a probable main sequence and
a giant stars branch. The absence of a cluster sequence combined with the
poor and noisy overdensity are all against the reliability of this cluster.
%
The Anderson-Darling test in Fig. \ref{fig30}, right panel, is clear regarding
the true nature of vdBH 91 since the high combined $p$-value
indicates that the null hypothesis (cluster and field areas come from the same
originating distribution) con not be reasonably rejected. This result is against
the \cite{Kharchenko_2005} findings who found that vdBH 91 is a cluster at
0.740 kpc, approximately $160\times10^6$ yr old and affected by a mean color
excess $E(B-V) = 0.08$.\\

We conclude that vdBH 91 is a random fluctuation of the stellar
foreground/background, and not a real entity.

\section{Ruprecht 88}

RUP 88 is another potential cluster south of the Carina HII region. Like
other objects in this paper no obvious stellar grouping is perceived in the $V$
image of Fig. \ref{fig2}. The overall star CMDs in Fig. \ref{fig31} show a
scattered star distribution above $V = 16$ mag. From this magnitude down the
common pattern of galactic disc stars takes place in the CMDs. The CCD in Fig.
\ref{fig31} suggests that no blue and therefore young star is present in the
region of RUP 88. Just at $0.2 < (B-V) < 0.8$ we see a handful of stars that
could be reddened late of late $B$- types or $A-F$-type stars. The remaining of
this diagram is a trace composed by $A$- to $M$-type stars.\\

As with other clusters in the present sample, when the spatial distribution
of stars in the frame is analyzed no clear star overdensity
appears in the location where RUP 88 is supposed to exist. In fact, the
contour plot in Fig. \ref{fig32}, left panel, shows a poor star number
enhancement from south west to northeast of the frame extending north west.
Given the difficulties to state the position of the cluster center (if it
exists) we ask \texttt{ASteCA} to inspect the region encircled in green in Fig.
\ref{fig32}, where a reasonable density profile could be found. The
RDP is still noisy because of a rather poor star number contained between the
assumed cluster limits. If we look at Fig. \ref{fig33}, in the CMDs, only 38
stars with probabilities ranging from 0.01 to 0.71 remain inside the adopted
cluster region, quite low membership probability values perhaps reflecting the
trouble to set aside the cluster region from the field region. The findings in
the three photometric diagrams in Fig. \ref{fig33} confirm this point as only an
amorphous distribution of stars scarcely resembling a cluster main sequence can
be seen.\\

The Anderson-Darling test in Fig. \ref{fig34}, right panel is unable to
separate the cluster population from the one from the field region, for all the
three explored dimensions. The combined $p$-value for proper
motions and parallaxes is large, suggesting that both samples do not come from
the same population. The necessary requirement that there is a reasonable main
sequence is absent and, combined with this result, precludes
concluding that RUP 88 is a true cluster.

\section{van den Bergh-Hagen 92}

Placed south of Vela, near the eastern border with Carina, vdBH
92 is a relevant handful of bright stars as seen in the $V$ image of Fig.
\ref{fig2}. The CMDs and CCD for all stars in the region, as shown in Fig.
\ref{fig35}, depict a narrow star sequence with some scatter at their respective
bright ends. Particularly the CCD shows, not far from the intrinsic line, a
group of $F$- and $G$-type stars and another group of stars below the intrinsic
line that could be $B$- and $A$- type stars displaced by the reddening effect.\\

\texttt{ASteCA} analysis in Fig. \ref{fig36} revealed the presence of a well
isolated star overdensity rising above the field stars density of about 4
stars per square arcmin. We identify this overdensity with vdBH
92. Notwithstanding the noisy RDP the limits of the overdensity can be well
established. As indicated in Fig. \ref{fig37} few stars have been found inside
the cluster limits with membership values from 0.81 to 0.97. Despite such a low
number of members, a 7 magnitude extended cluster main sequence is been found.
The comparison with synthetic clusters made by \texttt{ASteCA} yields:

\begin{itemize}
\item [a)] the best fitting of a synthetic cluster to the clean data in Fig. 
    \ref{fig37} indicates a color excess of $E(B-V) = 0.66$. Since the
    maximum color excess provided by S\&F2011 is 2.34 for this zone we
    conclude that most of the absorption is produced behind the position of van
    den Bergh-Hagen 92. This object is therefore placed in front of a strong
    absorption region.
\item [b)] The absorption free distance modulus becomes 11.5 what places van den
    Bergh-Hagen 92 at a distance of $d=2$ kpc.
\end{itemize}

By applying the Anderson-Darling test it is noticed that the parallax
distributions for stars inside and outside the cluster boundaries are not
different from each other as indicated in the right panel of Fig. 
\ref{fig38}. However, proper motions are quite different in both regions. We
associate this last finding with the presence of a well defined overdensity
that, in turn, shows a reasonable and extended cluster main sequence to
conclude that both samples come from different populations.\\

All this together confirm the true nature of vdBH 92. This is a
young cluster $83\times10^6$ years old.

\section{Trumpler 13}

TR 13 is a weak object also at the south west of the Carina HII
region, seen as a diffuse but extended star accumulation near the center of the
$V$ image in Fig. \ref{fig2}. The two CMDs in Fig. \ref{fig39} show an uncommon
pattern: we see that above $V = 17.5$ mag the star sequence splits into two
branches with one of them extending to the bluest side while other branch
follows the common representation of galaxy disc stars.
In the CCD the situation is the same: a wide and reddened band of potential
$B$-type stars is placed for $(B-V)<0.45$ and for $-0.25<(U-B)<0.5$ with a few
more stars at negative $(U-B)$ index while another strip of stars goes from the
characteristic place for $F$-type stars extending to the red tail including
probable giant stars.\\

Fig. \ref{fig40} indicates that \texttt{ASteCA} found a spatially extended
overdensity mostly elongated north-south, which, at its peak is nearly 5 times
above a mean field stellar density of 12 stars per square arcmin. Given the
shape and extension of the overdensity we adopted a formal radius 3.7 arcmin and
asked \texttt{ASteCA} to compute the membership probabilities for those stars
inside the area. Fig. \ref{fig41} shows that after the removal of field
interlopers, almost 180 stars with membership values from 0.04 to 0.97 are left
composing a narrow cluster main sequence extending for more than 6 magnitudes.
Consequently, when comparing with synthetic clusters the results yield:

\begin{itemize}
\item [a)] A color excess of $E(B-V)= 0.55$ is found for the best fitting of
a synthetic cluster. Since the maximum color excess provided by S\&F2011
is 1.94 it is reasonable to conclude that most of the absorption is produced
behind the position of TR 13.
\item [b)] The absorption free distance modulus of TR 13 is estimated to be
13.0 mag, placing it at a distance of 3.98 kpc from the Sun.
\end{itemize}

The Anderson-Darling statistics in Fig. \ref{fig42}, right panel, confirm the
photometric results. In fact, cluster area and the surrounding field region
possess quite different properties.\\

Although not particularly large, probabilities for stars inside the
overdensity confirm the true nature of this object since the over density
and the density profile are followed by a very well defined and extended
photometric counterpart. All these facts combined with the results from the
Anderson-Darling test are self-consistent, so that we are confident that
TR 13 is a young cluster $27\times10^6$ years old.

\section{van den Bergh-Hagen 106}

This cluster is placed at the south-east of the Vela constellation. The not so
dense stellar field where it is placed has no relevant features except a few
moderately bright stars as shown in Fig. \ref{fig2}. The CMDs shown in
Fig. \ref{fig43} represent typical photometric features structures of galactic
fields with no cluster inside. As for the CCD in the same figure it shows a
reduced number of stars below the intrinsic line (probably reddened late $B$-
and $A$ types) and a tail of stars from of late $F$-types to $M$-type stars
–some of them probably giant- at the red end.
%
\texttt{ASteCA} spatial analysis found some star clumps as seen in Fig. 
\ref{fig44}, left panel. We focus the attention on the main one at the very
center of the frame, since here we see the highest overdensity peak with 4 times
more stars than at the mean stellar background density of 7 stars per square
arcmin approximately. We assume that most of stars in vdBH 106
must be included there so the cluster parameters should be well established. It
is a fact that the RDP appears not well defined since it reflects the irregular
and poor star density even inside the zone selected to investigate the cluster
parameters. Only 87 stars have been found inside this area. The
membership values for stars inside the putative cluster position range from 0.23
to 0.91. However, those stars having probabilities near the maximum values in
this region still outline a cluster main sequence that can be fitted with a
synthetic cluster which yields the following parameters:

\begin{itemize}
\item [a)] A color excess of $E(B-V) = 0.30$ has been found to affect the
cluster. This value is well in line with the maximum color excess provided
by S\&F2011, $E(B-V) = 0.57$ in this direction.
\item [b)] The absorption free distance modulus of vdBH 106 was found to be
14 mag, putting the cluster at a distance of $d=6.3$ kpc from the Sun.
\end{itemize}

In this region we found from the application of the Anderson-Darling test that
the parallax and proper motion distributions seem to belong to the same
originating distribution, as seen in Fig. \ref{fig46}. Indeed, the
large combined p-value makes the rejection of the null hypothesis difficult,
since the probability of erroneously rejecting it is around $22\%$ (capped
at that maximum value by the Python package used to estimate it).\\

Despite a trace of a sequence belonging to a typical old cluster is
noticeable in Fig. \ref{fig45}, we are cautious as to confirm its nature.
Clearly deeper photometric observations (particularly in the $U$ filter) are
needed. Meanwhile and under the assumption we are facing a true object van
den Bergh-Hagen 106 could be an old open cluster around $9705\times10^6$ years
old (the oldest in our sample).

\section{Ruprecht 162}
\label{app:rup162}

Placed to the south east of the Carina HII region, the $V$ image of the region
in Fig. \ref{fig2} where the cluster is supposed to exist shows a moderate
number of stars resembling a star grouping placed at the north-west in the
frame. At first sight the CMDs in Fig. \ref{fig47} for the overall stars look
as if a cluster main sequence is emerging from the trace of the disk star
distribution.
In the same figure, right panel, the CCD splits into two star groups: one of
them is mostly placed below the intrinsic line for $0.0<(B-V)< 0.8$ and
resembles a strip of reddened blue stars (including early and late $B$-types
and, perhaps, some $A$-type stars); the other group shows a distribution of $F$-
to $M$-type stars strongly affected by reddening in appearance.\\

\texttt{ASteCA} detected an extended and irregular region at the north-west of
the frame in Fig. \ref{fig48} (where the cluster is supposed to lie). Given the
difficulties to set a clear overdensity we decided to focus the attention on the
zone encircled in green in Fig. \ref{fig48}, left panel. The background mean star
density is over 12 stars per squared arcmin and, at the most, the overdensity is
just 20 stars at the maximum. This produces unavoidably a noisy RDP (it is hard
to establish a meaningful radius and there is a quite irregular star
distribution across the zone).
%
The CMDs and CCD in Fig. \ref{fig49} after the removal of field interlopers tell
us that stars in the adopted cluster region have membership probabilities in the
range 0.03 to 1.0. Stars above $G=16$ mag have membership values over 0.6 but
are all scattered in the range $0.2<(B-V)<2$. When one looks closely at the
right and left panels in Fig. \ref{fig49}, a small group of stars with the
largest memberships appear at the low mass end.
The cleaned CCD, Fig. \ref{fig49} mid panel, leaves a blue sequence of stars
suffering some internal color scatter followed by a tail of $F$- to $K$-type
stars. Therefore this object could be more extended than supposed. 
\texttt{ASteCA} found the best fitting with a synthetic cluster with the
following properties:

% TODO arreglar intervalo
\begin{itemize}
\item [a)] The color excess affecting the cluster is $E(B-V) =0.47$ inside
the values given by S\&F2011 who estimate $E(B-V) = 1.07$ at maximum and
0.91 at minimum. 
\item [b)] The absorption free distance modulus is 12.3 mag corresponding to a
distance of $d = 2.9$ kpc.
\end{itemize}

Anderson-Darling statistical test results are shown in Fig. \ref{fig50}, right
panel. Parallaxes and proper motions $PM(\alpha)$ and $PM(\delta)$ in the
location of RUP 162 and the surrounding field region do not seem to be
different enough from each other as to be efficiently disentangled.\\

Although weak enough the presence of a probable main sequence in the 
panels of Fig. \ref{fig49}, make us cautious leaving some chance for RUP 162 to
be a true and young cluster about $31\times10^6$ yr old. An additional
reinforcement as for the hypothetical true entity of this young object is the
existence of a sudden gap along the main sequence at $G=16.5$ mag and the
presence of high probability stars at the red side resembling traces of a
pre-main sequence. Certainly we are just speculating on this fact so that more
and deeper observations are needed to arrive to a concluding result for RUP
162.

\section{Lynga 15}

This is an intriguing object placed in Centaurus, south west between Crux and
the east border of Carina. More specifically, Lynga 15 is about $1^\circ$
north-east of the star formation region SFR293.64-1.41 \citep{Avedisova_2002}.
Like in many other cases already shown in the $V$ images in Fig. \ref{fig2}
this region does not show, at first glance, any prominent stellar feature
though some stars are bright enough as to attract attention to this place.
Maybe the detection of a planetary nebula (\textcolor{red}{PN Hf 69,
reference!}) is another reason to draw the attention.
However, the overall CMDs and CCD shown in Fig. \ref{fig51}
are quite surprising since both CMDs depict an extended sequence (from $V = 8$
down to $V = 16$ mag) emerging toward the left side of the main disc population
trace. In the same figure, right panel, the CCD shows a strip of blue stars
($0.6<(B-V)<0.0$) accompanied by other, probable reddened early type stars,
placed above $(U-B) = 0.0$. The picture seen in the three panels of Fig.
\ref{fig51} induces to think of Lynga 15 as a quite young open cluster.\\

In turn, \texttt{ASteCA} analysis of the spatial structure found an extended and
irregular star overdensity reaching few more than 20 stars per square arcmin.
After many attempts to look for the place where the star membership
probabilities reach the highest values we adopted a 4.6 arcmin radius and set
the potential cluster center in the literature coordinates as indicated in Fig.
\ref{fig52}, left panel. In this place, the RDP displays a 10 stars per squared
arcmin peak above the stellar field density, as seen in the right panel of Fig. 
\ref{fig52}.
However, even in this position \texttt{ASteCA} yields a conflictive result
since star membership probabilities go from 0.3 to 0.94 but as seen in Fig. 
\ref{fig53}, left and right panels, a probable cluster main sequence mostly
composed by low probability stars appears below approximately $G=17.5$ mag.
Above this visual magnitude the main sequence vanishes and just a handful of
stars with large probability values, scattered in color index and magnitudes,
takes place a full magnitude above. This is, no upper cluster main sequence is
evident in the clean CMDs. It draws the attention that the CCD in the mid panel
of Fig. \ref{fig53} contains a few blue stars with no counterpart in the CMDs.
This could be explained this way: all across the surveyed region there are blue
stars (see the overall CCD in Fig. \ref{fig51}) composing a sort of Blue Plume
in the respective CMDs and just by chance some blue stars also appear in the
potential cluster region after \texttt{ASteCA} analysis (mid panel Fig. 
\ref{fig53}). It could be possible yet that Lynga 15 is an
extended open cluster (even larger than the size of our frame) but the presence
of the huge star gap above $G=17.5$ mag is unexplainable in a CMD from a
statistical point of view. In our opinion and from a photometric and spatial
point of view Lynga 15 is not an open cluster. The application of the Anderson-
Darling test inform us that the properties of stars inside the adopted cluster
radius and outside of it are similar, with a probability above 6\% of
mistakenly rejecting the null hypothesis (i.e.: not low enough to reject it).\\

We conclude that Lynga 15 is not a true cluster but a superposition of blue
stars at several distances along the line of sight (see that this is highly
probable). This is not odd at all since this object is not
far from the galactic equator and it is close enough to SFR293.64-1.41 as
indicated above; so, it is probable that blue stars are seen along the direction
to this potential cluster.

\section{Loden 565}

Placed toward the west side of the Crux constellation the $V$ image in Fig. 
\ref{fig2} of Loden 565 does not show any evident star grouping. Inspection of
the CCD and CMDs in Fig. \ref{fig55} only suggests the presence of a dispersed
star group down to $V= 15-16$ mag approximately. From this magnitude down the
overall CMDs show the common pattern of galactic disc star population and
nothing relevant can be seen in the CCD in the mid panel of Fig. \ref{fig55}, but
a modest handful of probable slightly reddened late blue stars for
$(B-V)<0.6$.\\

\texttt{ASteCA} found an irregular overdensity at the north-west corner of the
frame as seen in Fig. \ref{fig56}, left panel. This is the only region across the
entire field where a sudden increase in the star number per area unit is
noticeable showing a 25 stars per squared arcmin peak at its maximum in Fig. 
\ref{fig56}, right panel.
%
When looking for membership probabilities only a small number of 58 stars
remain inside the adopted radius with probabilities ranging from 0.52 to 0.65,
quite low indeed. Still at such low values a weak lower main sequence appears
in the CMDs in Fig. \ref{fig57} while other stars with larger values are
scattered along above $G=16$ mag. Notice that none of the stars that
occupy the CCD of Fig. \ref{fig55} (right panel) with $0<(B-V)<0.6$, with some
chances to be reddened early type stars, remain inside the adopted area after 
\texttt{ASteCA}'s membership analysis. The stars that \texttt{ASteCA}
identified inside the adopted radius could be members of an old group but we
conclude that the photometric evidences are not conclusive at all. More extended
and deeper observations are necessary. Previous estimates of the cluster
parameters found for Loden 565 can be found in \cite{Kharchenko_2005}.
These authors concluded that Loden 565 is a moderately young cluster placed at a
distance of $d = 0.650$ kpc, affected by a mean reddening $E(B-V)= 0.2$ and
a little older than $10^8$ yrs. The \cite{Kharchenko_2005} atlas shows a
poor fitting to a very sparse available data. In addition, when inspecting the
results from the Anderson-Darling test in the right panel of Fig. \ref{fig58},
it becomes evident that the cluster region is indistinguishable from the
stellar background in terms of parallax and proper motion distributions,
exactly as the clean CCD and CMDs show in Fig. \ref{fig57}.\\

In conclusion, Loden 565 is more probably a stellar fluctuation.

\section{NGC 4230}

This object belongs to the Centaurus region immediately close to the upper
border of Crux. The $V$ image in Fig. \ref{fig2} shows that we are facing just a
modest star grouping near the high proper motion star HD 106826
(\textcolor{red}{is this of some value?}) with 8.8 mag. Nothing relevant is
appreciable in the $V$ image of the inspected zone except the star already
mentioned. A highly scattered and diffuse star distribution resembling a boring
galactic disc stellar pattern appears in the overall CCD and CMDs in the panels
of Fig. \ref{fig59}.\\

The spatial inspection performed by \texttt{ASteCA} detected a group of small
stellar overdensities surrounding the central prominence as shown in Fig.
\ref{fig60}, left panel. The peak of the central overdensity shows that the
number of stars per area unit is three times the mean of the background, and the
respective RDP in the right panel of Fig. \ref{fig60} suggests a 2.7 arcmin
radius. However, \texttt{ASteCA} yielded a frustrating result in terms of what
it is expected for a real cluster when analyzing the stellar properties inside
and outside the overdensity. In fact, only 44 stars remain inside the limits we
adopted for NGC 4230 whose membership probability values range from 0.40 to
0.87. The synthetic cluster fit is found for the low mass stars with the
smaller MP values. At this membership level there is no way to confidently
separate the stellar population into those objects belonging to a real open
cluster and those others belonging to the stellar field. The CCD and CMDs of
these 44 stars in Fig. \ref{fig61} reflect the physical situation since no main
sequence is evident at all. At most, there is a sort of badly defined giant
star sequence whose meaning is dubious because there is no trace of a main
sequence. The comparison with synthetic clusters performed by \texttt{ASteCA}
fitted mainly a group of stars with low brightness, as shown in the CMDs of
Fig. \ref{fig61}. This cluster is analyzed in \cite{Tadross_2011} where the
authors find an old 1.7 Gyrs cluster (similar to our result of 4.3 Gyrs) but at
a much closer distance (1445 pc versus our result of about 11000 pc) Therefore
the studies do not coincide in the nature of this supposed cluster.\\

Results for the distribution of parallax values and proper motions for the
cluster and field regions are shown in Fig. \ref{fig62}, right panel.
We see that the Anderson-Darling statistics reveals that the parallax and
proper motions distributions are very different for stars outside the
cluster region.\\

The lack of a well-defined photometric sequence proper of an open cluster as
demonstrated in Fig. \ref{fig61} together with the results from
the statistical comparison is enough argument to exclude NGC 4230 as a true open
cluster, becoming most probably a random fluctuation of the stellar field.
